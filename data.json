More like a ceramic bowl than your standard food container and with better functionality. The 'glass like' lid locks to the body for a water tight seal and has an ingenious sauce dipping area (great for sushi lovers). A sauce pot is ideal for salad dressing (or ketchup), so you can dress your salad just before you eat it. An inner dish allows you to split different foods so you can microwave a hot dish, but keep other foods cold. We have now retooled the lid mould so that the hinges can be bent all of the way round, making them stronger and more malleable hence eliminating the problem found with earlier production lids.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Instructions for the gift recipient*\r\n\r\nTo redeem your gift card, follow these steps: \r\n1.
